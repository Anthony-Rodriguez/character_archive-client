# Character Archive

## Planning Story

As a Dungeons & Dragons(D&D) DM, I find that there could be many more tools available to us to make our jobs easier. Oh alright, they exist, but they cost money. And as a DM without the capital to purchase those tools, I decided to make 'em myself!

In D&D, I have created a plethora of characters for my players to interact with. There's usually a long description associated with their appearance, and so I thought to myself. "Self, why not create an archive of all your characters?" So I decided to make a character archive where a user can store all of their characters for easy recall.
## User Stories

- As a user, I want to sign up so I can have access to an archive

- As a user, I want to be able to change my password for security
- As a user, I want to sign out of my account to prevent others from using it.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a character
- As a user, I want to edit the characters I have
- As a user, I want to delete the characters I have made
